This is the UI I have had since BfA as a WeakAura.
With the death of WeakAuras, I have had to convert it into an addon.

The philosophy is simple:
The interface is built on a horizontal axis.
This means that default UI frames have to 'fight' for space with other frames in order to be visible.
It often results in UI clutter. This issue is exaggerated by addons creating even more custom frames that have to exist on a horizontal plane.
The issue of space became glaring for me when I had to move and adjust the camera just so I could see my nameplates underneath party and arena frames.
Moreover, because of the limited space that frames are given, child frames have to be smaller or reside outside of the frame.
This has been true for both cooldown tracking and buffs. Buff icons tend to be tiny, and cooldown tracking (now obsolete, but still relevant) had to be placed near the corners of the screen.
Both of these design choices make it difficult to view the information on the screen in a constructive way.

This UI constructs frames for party, player, target, and arena that are vertical. Their construction is equivalent, they both grow from the middle towards the left and right to represent Party and Arena 1..X.
This creates an intuitive way to quickly locate a unit member, since Party2 and Arena2, for example, are equally distanced from the center.
Further, because the frames occupy the left and right side of the screen on a 0 Y-axis, the middle, top, and bottom of the screen remain empty.
That means that nameplates directly in front of a player and around them are always visible.
Another concomitant effect is that vertical frames allow for all buffs, debuffs, and other related frames attached to party and arena to be displayed as larger icons across the frames.
The health bar remains visible, and the buffs are easier to read.

I will keep this updated for as long as I play, because I have gotten too comfortable with these frames to use the default option.
